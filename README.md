## SLAC RCE SDK
We use the [SLAC RCE Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/RPTUSER/SDK+Download+and+Installation) a lot. 
This environment script assumes that a version of the SDK has been downloaded
and unpacked to `${COB_HOME}/sdk`. My setup has a symlink from `sdk` to the version
unpacked from the tarball.
