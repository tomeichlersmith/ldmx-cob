# ldmx-cob

Notes and helper scripts for working with LDMX COBs.

## Setup
Similar to this [tracking dotfiles tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

Define where your `cob` working directory is going to be.
In my work, I have it in `~/cob`. Then

```
mkdir ~/cob
git clone --bare <this-repo> $HOME/cob/.git
```
